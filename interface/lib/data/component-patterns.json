Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my real estate business following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual Direction: Sophisticated and aspirational. Use full-width, high-resolution images of Orlando luxury homes (e.g., waterfront estates in Lake Butler, modern villas in Dr. Phillips) with warm, natural lighting to evoke warmth and success. Avoid stock photos‚Äîopt for professional shots of actual listings or staged lifestyle imagery (e.g., a family enjoying a poolside evening or a couple reviewing investment documents by a floor-to-ceiling window). Color Palette: Deep navy blues and charcoal grays for trust and professionalism, accented with gold or warm brass tones to signify luxury. Use crisp white for text backgrounds to ensure readability. Secondary accents in soft cream or sage green can add a touch of Florida‚Äôs natural elegance. Typography: Clean, modern serif fonts (e.g., a refined didone or transitional serif) for headings to convey prestige, paired with a simple sans-serif for body text to ensure clarity. Generous line height and letter spacing to enhance legibility and sophistication. Spacing & Hierarchy: Ample whitespace around the hero content to draw attention to the headline, subheadline, and CTA. Stack elements vertically for mobile responsiveness, with the headline and CTA always remaining above the fold. Use a subtle grid layout to align text and images cleanly. Buttons & Links: Primary CTA buttons in deep navy with gold or white text, featuring a slight bevel or gradient to appear tactile. Hover effects should darken the button slightly and add a subtle inward shadow. Secondary links (e.g., \"Explore Listings\") can use gold outlines with a transparent fill. Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile. Micro-Interactions: Smooth fade-in animations for the hero text and images as the page loads. The CTA button can have a gentle pulse animation (once) to draw attention. On hover, buttons should respond with a fluid color transition (no abrupt changes). Imagery Style: Use ultra-high-definition images shot during golden hour to highlight architectural details and landscaping. Crop images to focus on key selling points (e.g., a grand entrance, a chef‚Äôs kitchen, or a backyard oasis). Include at least one image with a \"Sold\" sign or a happy family to subtly reinforce success and fulfillment. Header Include a logo placeholder (e.g., a sleek monogram or wordmark in gold/navy) aligned to the left. Minimal navigation with two links: \"Featured Listings\" (anchored to a future section) and \"Contact\" (opens a simple contact form or phone link). A \"Schedule a Tour\" CTA button in gold or navy, fixed to the right side of the header for persistent visibility. Mobile optimization: Collapse navigation into a hamburger menu with the same two links + CTA. Hero Purpose: Capture attention, communicate exclusivity, and drive immediate lead capture or consultation booking. Content Spec: Headline: \"Orlando‚Äôs Finest Luxury Homes | Your Legacy Starts Here\" (or \"Invest in Orlando‚Äôs Elite Real Estate‚ÄîWhere Prestige Meets Profit\"). Subheadline: \"Exclusive waterfront estates, private golf communities, and high-ROI investment properties in Lake Nona, Windermere, and Dr. Phillips.

Secondary CTA Link: \"Or call (XXX) XXX-XXXX for a private consultation\" (click-to-call on mobile). Trust Signal: \"Trusted by 200+ Orlando families and investors | $500M+ in luxury properties sold.\" Layout Spec: Full-width background image of a hero property (e.g., a twilight shot of a Lake Butler mansion with pool and dock lighting). Overlay a semi-transparent navy gradient (60% opacity) on the image to improve text contrast. Center-align the headline, subheadline, and CTAs vertically and horizontally. Text should appear slightly above the midpoint of the screen for desktop. Stack elements vertically on mobile, with the headline font size scaling down to 2.5rem (from 4rem on desktop). Add 100px padding above and below the text block to ensure breathing room. Component Spec: Lead Capture Form (popup or embedded): Fields: Name, Email, Phone (optional), and a dropdown to select interest (\"Primary Residence\" or \"Investment Property\"). Submit Button: \"Unlock Your Guide Now\" in gold with navy text. Success State: Redirect to a thank-you message with a calendar booking link for a consultation. Floating WhatsApp/Call Icon: Fixed to the bottom-right corner (gold circle with a phone icon) for instant contact. Interactions: Hero image should load with a subtle zoom-out effect (from 105% to 100% scale) over 2 seconds. CTA button pulses once (a gentle 5% scale increase/decrease) 3 seconds after page load. On hover, the CTA button darkens by 10% and lifts slightly with a 2px shadow. Form fields should have a smooth bottom-border animation on focus (e.g., border color transitions from light gray to gold).

Spacing & Hierarchy: Ample whitespace around the hero content to draw attention to the headline, subheadline, and CTA. Stack elements vertically for mobile responsiveness, with the headline and CTA always remaining above the fold. Use a subtle grid layout to align text and images cleanly. Buttons & Links: Primary CTA buttons in deep navy with gold or white text, featuring a slight bevel or gradient to appear tactile. Hover effects should darken the button slightly and add a subtle inward shadow. Secondary links (e.g., \"Explore Listings\") can use gold outlines with a transparent fill. Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile. Micro-Interactions: Smooth fade-in animations for the hero text and images as the page loads. The CTA button can have a gentle pulse animation (once) to draw attention. On hover, buttons should respond with a fluid color transition (no abrupt changes). Imagery Style: Use ultra-high-definition images shot during golden hour to highlight architectural details and landscaping. Crop images to focus on key selling points (e.g., a grand entrance, a chef‚Äôs kitchen, or a backyard oasis). Include at least one image with a \"Sold\" sign or a happy family to subtly reinforce success and fulfillment. Header Include a logo placeholder (e.g., a sleek monogram or wordmark in gold/navy) aligned to the left. Minimal navigation with two links: \"Featured Listings\" (anchored to a future section) and \"Contact\" (opens a simple contact form or phone link). A \"Schedule a Tour\" CTA button in gold or navy, fixed to the right side of the header for persistent visibility. Mobile optimization: Collapse navigation into a hamburger menu with the same two links + CTA. Hero Purpose: Capture attention, communicate exclusivity, and drive immediate lead capture or consultation booking.

Subheadline: \"Exclusive waterfront estates, private golf communities, and high-ROI investment properties in Lake Nona, Windermere, and Dr. Phillips. Download our 2024 Insider‚Äôs Market Guide to discover hidden opportunities.\" Primary CTA Button: \"Get Your Free Market Guide\" (opens a lead capture form). Secondary CTA Link: \"Or call (XXX) XXX-XXXX for a private consultation\" (click-to-call on mobile). Trust Signal: \"Trusted by 200+ Orlando families and investors | $500M+ in luxury properties sold.\" Layout Spec: Full-width background image of a hero property (e.g., a twilight shot of a Lake Butler mansion with pool and dock lighting). Overlay a semi-transparent navy gradient (60% opacity) on the image to improve text contrast. Center-align the headline, subheadline, and CTAs vertically and horizontally. Text should appear slightly above the midpoint of the screen for desktop. Stack elements vertically on mobile, with the headline font size scaling down to 2.5rem (from 4rem on desktop). Add 100px padding above and below the text block to ensure breathing room. Component Spec: Lead Capture Form (popup or embedded): Fields: Name, Email, Phone (optional), and a dropdown to select interest (\"Primary Residence\" or \"Investment Property\"). Submit Button: \"Unlock Your Guide Now\" in gold with navy text. Success State: Redirect to a thank-you message with a calendar booking link for a consultation. Floating WhatsApp/Call Icon: Fixed to the bottom-right corner (gold circle with a phone icon) for instant contact. Interactions: Hero image should load with a subtle zoom-out effect (from 105% to 100% scale) over 2 seconds. CTA button pulses once (a gentle 5% scale increase/decrease) 3 seconds after page load. On hover, the CTA button darkens by 10% and lifts slightly with a 2px shadow. Form fields should have a smooth bottom-border animation on focus (e.g., border color transitions from light gray to gold).

Alt text: \"Exclusive Orlando luxury estate with private dock and infinity pool.\" Logo Placeholder: 300x100px SVG/PNG (gold/navy color scheme).

Avoid stock photos‚Äîopt for professional shots of actual listings or staged lifestyle imagery (e.g., a family enjoying a poolside evening or a couple reviewing investment documents by a floor-to-ceiling window). Color Palette: Deep navy blues and charcoal grays for trust and professionalism, accented with gold or warm brass tones to signify luxury. Use crisp white for text backgrounds to ensure readability. Secondary accents in soft cream or sage green can add a touch of Florida‚Äôs natural elegance. Typography: Clean, modern serif fonts (e.g., a refined didone or transitional serif) for headings to convey prestige, paired with a simple sans-serif for body text to ensure clarity. Generous line height and letter spacing to enhance legibility and sophistication. Spacing & Hierarchy: Ample whitespace around the hero content to draw attention to the headline, subheadline, and CTA. Stack elements vertically for mobile responsiveness, with the headline and CTA always remaining above the fold. Use a subtle grid layout to align text and images cleanly. Buttons & Links: Primary CTA buttons in deep navy with gold or white text, featuring a slight bevel or gradient to appear tactile. Hover effects should darken the button slightly and add a subtle inward shadow. Secondary links (e.g., \"Explore Listings\") can use gold outlines with a transparent fill. Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile. Micro-Interactions: Smooth fade-in animations for the hero text and images as the page loads. The CTA button can have a gentle pulse animation (once) to draw attention. On hover, buttons should respond with a fluid color transition (no abrupt changes). Imagery Style: Use ultra-high-definition images shot during golden hour to highlight architectural details and landscaping.

Include at least one image with a \"Sold\" sign or a happy family to subtly reinforce success and fulfillment.
