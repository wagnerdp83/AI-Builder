Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my real estate business following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual Direction: Sophisticated and aspirational. Use full-width, high-resolution images of Orlando luxury homes (e.g., waterfront estates in Lake Butler, modern villas in Dr. Phillips) with warm, natural lighting to evoke warmth and success. Avoid stock photos‚Äîopt for professional shots of actual listings or staged lifestyle imagery (e.g., a family enjoying a poolside evening or a couple reviewing investment documents by a floor-to-ceiling window). Color Palette: Deep navy blues and charcoal grays for trust and professionalism, accented with gold or warm brass tones to signify luxury. Use crisp white for text backgrounds to ensure readability. Secondary accents in soft cream or sage green can add a touch of Florida‚Äôs natural elegance. Typography: Clean, modern serif fonts (e.g., a refined didone or transitional serif) for headings to convey prestige, paired with a simple sans-serif for body text to ensure clarity. Generous line height and letter spacing to enhance legibility and sophistication. Spacing & Hierarchy: Ample whitespace around the hero content to draw attention to the headline, subheadline, and CTA. Stack elements vertically for mobile responsiveness, with the headline and CTA always remaining above the fold. Use a subtle grid layout to align text and images cleanly. Buttons & Links: Primary CTA buttons in deep navy with gold or white text, featuring a slight bevel or gradient to appear tactile. Hover effects should darken the button slightly and add a subtle inward shadow. Secondary links (e.g., \"Explore Listings\") can use gold outlines with a transparent fill. Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile. Micro-Interactions: Smooth fade-in animations for the hero text and images as the page loads. The CTA button can have a gentle pulse animation (once) to draw attention. On hover, buttons should respond with a fluid color transition (no abrupt changes). Imagery Style: Use ultra-high-definition images shot during golden hour to highlight architectural details and landscaping. Crop images to focus on key selling points (e.g., a grand entrance, a chef‚Äôs kitchen, or a backyard oasis). Include at least one image with a \"Sold\" sign or a happy family to subtly reinforce success and fulfillment. Header Include a logo placeholder (e.g., a sleek monogram or wordmark in gold/navy) aligned to the left. Minimal navigation with two links: \"Featured Listings\" (anchored to a future section) and \"Contact\" (opens a simple contact form or phone link). A \"Schedule a Tour\" CTA button in gold or navy, fixed to the right side of the header for persistent visibility. Mobile optimization: Collapse navigation into a hamburger menu with the same two links + CTA. Hero Purpose: Capture attention, communicate exclusivity, and drive immediate lead capture or consultation booking. Content Spec: Headline: \"Orlando‚Äôs Finest Luxury Homes | Your Legacy Starts Here\" (or \"Invest in Orlando‚Äôs Elite Real Estate‚ÄîWhere Prestige Meets Profit\"). Subheadline: \"Exclusive waterfront estates, private golf communities, and high-ROI investment properties in Lake Nona, Windermere, and Dr. Phillips.

Secondary CTA Link: \"Or call (XXX) XXX-XXXX for a private consultation\" (click-to-call on mobile). Trust Signal: \"Trusted by 200+ Orlando families and investors | $500M+ in luxury properties sold.\" Layout Spec: Full-width background image of a hero property (e.g., a twilight shot of a Lake Butler mansion with pool and dock lighting). Overlay a semi-transparent navy gradient (60% opacity) on the image to improve text contrast. Center-align the headline, subheadline, and CTAs vertically and horizontally. Text should appear slightly above the midpoint of the screen for desktop. Stack elements vertically on mobile, with the headline font size scaling down to 2.5rem (from 4rem on desktop). Add 100px padding above and below the text block to ensure breathing room. Component Spec: Lead Capture Form (popup or embedded): Fields: Name, Email, Phone (optional), and a dropdown to select interest (\"Primary Residence\" or \"Investment Property\"). Submit Button: \"Unlock Your Guide Now\" in gold with navy text. Success State: Redirect to a thank-you message with a calendar booking link for a consultation. Floating WhatsApp/Call Icon: Fixed to the bottom-right corner (gold circle with a phone icon) for instant contact. Interactions: Hero image should load with a subtle zoom-out effect (from 105% to 100% scale) over 2 seconds. CTA button pulses once (a gentle 5% scale increase/decrease) 3 seconds after page load. On hover, the CTA button darkens by 10% and lifts slightly with a 2px shadow. Form fields should have a smooth bottom-border animation on focus (e.g., border color transitions from light gray to gold).

Spacing & Hierarchy: Ample whitespace around the hero content to draw attention to the headline, subheadline, and CTA. Stack elements vertically for mobile responsiveness, with the headline and CTA always remaining above the fold. Use a subtle grid layout to align text and images cleanly. Buttons & Links: Primary CTA buttons in deep navy with gold or white text, featuring a slight bevel or gradient to appear tactile. Hover effects should darken the button slightly and add a subtle inward shadow. Secondary links (e.g., \"Explore Listings\") can use gold outlines with a transparent fill. Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile. Micro-Interactions: Smooth fade-in animations for the hero text and images as the page loads. The CTA button can have a gentle pulse animation (once) to draw attention. On hover, buttons should respond with a fluid color transition (no abrupt changes). Imagery Style: Use ultra-high-definition images shot during golden hour to highlight architectural details and landscaping. Crop images to focus on key selling points (e.g., a grand entrance, a chef‚Äôs kitchen, or a backyard oasis). Include at least one image with a \"Sold\" sign or a happy family to subtly reinforce success and fulfillment. Header Include a logo placeholder (e.g., a sleek monogram or wordmark in gold/navy) aligned to the left. Minimal navigation with two links: \"Featured Listings\" (anchored to a future section) and \"Contact\" (opens a simple contact form or phone link). A \"Schedule a Tour\" CTA button in gold or navy, fixed to the right side of the header for persistent visibility. Mobile optimization: Collapse navigation into a hamburger menu with the same two links + CTA. Hero Purpose: Capture attention, communicate exclusivity, and drive immediate lead capture or consultation booking.

Subheadline: \"Exclusive waterfront estates, private golf communities, and high-ROI investment properties in Lake Nona, Windermere, and Dr. Phillips. Download our 2024 Insider‚Äôs Market Guide to discover hidden opportunities.\" Primary CTA Button: \"Get Your Free Market Guide\" (opens a lead capture form). Secondary CTA Link: \"Or call (XXX) XXX-XXXX for a private consultation\" (click-to-call on mobile). Trust Signal: \"Trusted by 200+ Orlando families and investors | $500M+ in luxury properties sold.\" Layout Spec: Full-width background image of a hero property (e.g., a twilight shot of a Lake Butler mansion with pool and dock lighting). Overlay a semi-transparent navy gradient (60% opacity) on the image to improve text contrast. Center-align the headline, subheadline, and CTAs vertically and horizontally. Text should appear slightly above the midpoint of the screen for desktop. Stack elements vertically on mobile, with the headline font size scaling down to 2.5rem (from 4rem on desktop). Add 100px padding above and below the text block to ensure breathing room. Component Spec: Lead Capture Form (popup or embedded): Fields: Name, Email, Phone (optional), and a dropdown to select interest (\"Primary Residence\" or \"Investment Property\"). Submit Button: \"Unlock Your Guide Now\" in gold with navy text. Success State: Redirect to a thank-you message with a calendar booking link for a consultation. Floating WhatsApp/Call Icon: Fixed to the bottom-right corner (gold circle with a phone icon) for instant contact. Interactions: Hero image should load with a subtle zoom-out effect (from 105% to 100% scale) over 2 seconds. CTA button pulses once (a gentle 5% scale increase/decrease) 3 seconds after page load. On hover, the CTA button darkens by 10% and lifts slightly with a 2px shadow. Form fields should have a smooth bottom-border animation on focus (e.g., border color transitions from light gray to gold).

Alt text: \"Exclusive Orlando luxury estate with private dock and infinity pool.\" Logo Placeholder: 300x100px SVG/PNG (gold/navy color scheme).

Avoid stock photos‚Äîopt for professional shots of actual listings or staged lifestyle imagery (e.g., a family enjoying a poolside evening or a couple reviewing investment documents by a floor-to-ceiling window). Color Palette: Deep navy blues and charcoal grays for trust and professionalism, accented with gold or warm brass tones to signify luxury. Use crisp white for text backgrounds to ensure readability. Secondary accents in soft cream or sage green can add a touch of Florida‚Äôs natural elegance. Typography: Clean, modern serif fonts (e.g., a refined didone or transitional serif) for headings to convey prestige, paired with a simple sans-serif for body text to ensure clarity. Generous line height and letter spacing to enhance legibility and sophistication. Spacing & Hierarchy: Ample whitespace around the hero content to draw attention to the headline, subheadline, and CTA. Stack elements vertically for mobile responsiveness, with the headline and CTA always remaining above the fold. Use a subtle grid layout to align text and images cleanly. Buttons & Links: Primary CTA buttons in deep navy with gold or white text, featuring a slight bevel or gradient to appear tactile. Hover effects should darken the button slightly and add a subtle inward shadow. Secondary links (e.g., \"Explore Listings\") can use gold outlines with a transparent fill. Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile. Micro-Interactions: Smooth fade-in animations for the hero text and images as the page loads. The CTA button can have a gentle pulse animation (once) to draw attention. On hover, buttons should respond with a fluid color transition (no abrupt changes). Imagery Style: Use ultra-high-definition images shot during golden hour to highlight architectural details and landscaping.

Include at least one image with a \"Sold\" sign or a happy family to subtly reinforce success and fulfillment.

Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my business following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, minimalist, and sophisticated with a focus on large, high-resolution images that highlight your photography style. Use soft transitions and a balanced composition to evoke calm and professionalism. Color palette direction: Neutral tones like soft whites, warm grays, and muted blacks as the base, with subtle accents of deep red or forest green to add warmth and cultural relevance. These colors should complement the natural tones in your photography. Typography direction: Elegant and readable sans-serif for headlines to convey modernity, paired with a clean serif for body text to add a touch of sophistication. Ensure generous line spacing for readability. Spacing and hierarchy: Use ample whitespace to let your photography breathe. Create a clear visual path from the headline to the CTA button, with secondary elements like navigation subtly placed. Buttons and links: A deep red or forest green rounded rectangle button with white text for the primary CTA, which darkens slightly on hover. Secondary links should be underlined and in a muted gray to avoid competition with the main action. Micro-interactions: Subtle fade-in animations for the headline and CTA button as the page loads. The button should have a smooth scaling effect on hover to draw attention. Imagery style: Use high-resolution, professionally shot images that represent your best work‚Äîfocus on candid, emotionally expressive portraits of families and individuals. Images should feel authentic and aspirational, cropped to highlight faces and connections. Header Include a centered logo placeholder at the top, with a minimal navigation menu below it containing links to \"Home,\" \"Gallery,\" \"Services,\" \"About,\" and \"Contact.\" Add a small, subtle contact CTA (e.g., \"Book Now\") in the top-right corner, styled as an outlined button in muted gray. Ensure the header remains fixed at the top of the page for easy access as visitors scroll. Hero Purpose/goal: Capture attention immediately with a stunning visual and compelling headline, then guide visitors toward booking a session. Content spec: A bold, emotionally resonant headline (e.g., \"Capture Life‚Äôs Most Precious Moments with Timeless Photography in Japan\"). A short subheadline (2-3 lines) explaining your unique approach (e.g., \"Our studio specializes in creating natural, heartfelt portraits that tell your family‚Äôs story. Serving individuals and families in [City] with elegance and professionalism.\"). A primary CTA button labeled \"Book Your Session\" linked to a contact form or calendar. A secondary text link below the button for visitors who want to explore more: \"View Our Gallery ‚Üí\". Layout spec: Full-width section with a large, high-resolution background image (slightly darkened overlay for text readability) showcasing one of your best family or portrait shots. Center-align the headline, subheadline, and CTA vertically and horizontally for a balanced, focused look. Ensure the section is responsive, with text and buttons stacking vertically on mobile devices while maintaining ample spacing. Component spec: The CTA button should be large, with rounded corners, filled with a deep red or forest green color, and white text. It should darken slightly when hovered over. The secondary link should be a simple, underlined text in muted gray, placed 10 pixels below the button. Interactions: The headline and CTA button should fade in smoothly as the page loads, with the button having a slight scale-up effect on hover. The background image should remain static but be optimized for fast loading to avoid delays. Assets: Background image: A high-resolution photograph (1920x1080px or larger) featuring a candid, emotionally rich family or individual portrait. Preferred format: JPEG or WebP for optimal quality and load speed. Alt text for the image: \"A heartfelt family portrait session in [City], Japan, capturing timeless moments with professional photography.\" Footer Include a centered logo placeholder at the top of the footer.

Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my business following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, minimalist, and sophisticated with a focus on large, high-resolution images that highlight your photography style. Use soft transitions and a balanced composition to evoke calm and professionalism. Color palette direction: Neutral tones like soft whites, warm grays, and muted blacks as the base, with subtle accents of deep red or forest green to add warmth and cultural relevance. These colors should complement the natural tones in your photography. Typography direction: Elegant and readable sans-serif for headlines to convey modernity, paired with a clean serif for body text to add a touch of sophistication. Ensure generous line spacing for readability. Spacing and hierarchy: Use ample whitespace to let your photography breathe. Create a clear visual path from the headline to the CTA button, with secondary elements like navigation subtly placed. Buttons and links: A deep red or forest green rounded rectangle button with white text for the primary CTA, which darkens slightly on hover. Secondary links should be underlined and in a muted gray to avoid competition with the main action. Micro-interactions: Subtle fade-in animations for the headline and CTA button as the page loads. The button should have a smooth scaling effect on hover to draw attention. Imagery style: Use high-resolution, professionally shot images that represent your best work‚Äîfocus on candid, emotionally expressive portraits of families and individuals. Images should feel authentic and aspirational, cropped to highlight faces and connections. Header Include a centered logo placeholder at the top, with a minimal navigation menu below it containing links to \"Home,\" \"Gallery,\" \"Services,\" \"About,\" and \"Contact.\" Add a small, subtle contact CTA (e.g., \"Book Now\") in the top-right corner, styled as an outlined button in muted gray. Ensure the header remains fixed at the top of the page for easy access as visitors scroll. Hero Purpose/goal: Capture attention immediately with a stunning visual and compelling headline, then guide visitors toward booking a session. Content spec: A bold, emotionally resonant headline (e.g., \"Capture Life‚Äôs Most Precious Moments with Timeless Photography in Japan\"). A short subheadline (2-3 lines) explaining your unique approach (e.g., \"Our studio specializes in creating natural, heartfelt portraits that tell your family‚Äôs story. Serving individuals and families in [City] with elegance and professionalism.\"). A primary CTA button labeled \"Book Your Session\" linked to a contact form or calendar. A secondary text link below the button for visitors who want to explore more: \"View Our Gallery ‚Üí\". Layout spec: Full-width section with a large, high-resolution background image (slightly darkened overlay for text readability) showcasing one of your best family or portrait shots. Center-align the headline, subheadline, and CTA vertically and horizontally for a balanced, focused look. Ensure the section is responsive, with text and buttons stacking vertically on mobile devices while maintaining ample spacing. Component spec: The CTA button should be large, with rounded corners, filled with a deep red or forest green color, and white text. It should darken slightly when hovered over. The secondary link should be a simple, underlined text in muted gray, placed 10 pixels below the button. Interactions: The headline and CTA button should fade in smoothly as the page loads, with the button having a slight scale-up effect on hover. The background image should remain static but be optimized for fast loading to avoid delays. Assets: Background image: A high-resolution photograph (1920x1080px or larger) featuring a candid, emotionally rich family or individual portrait. Preferred format: JPEG or WebP for optimal quality and load speed. Alt text for the image: \"A heartfelt family portrait session in [City], Japan, capturing timeless moments with professional photography.\" Footer Include a centered logo placeholder at the top of the footer.

Images should feel authentic and aspirational, cropped to highlight faces and connections. Header Include a centered logo placeholder at the top, with a minimal navigation menu below it containing links to \"Home,\" \"Gallery,\" \"Services,\" \"About,\" and \"Contact.\" Add a small, subtle contact CTA (e.g., \"Book Now\") in the top-right corner, styled as an outlined button in muted gray. Ensure the header remains fixed at the top of the page for easy access as visitors scroll. Hero Purpose/goal: Capture attention immediately with a stunning visual and compelling headline, then guide visitors toward booking a session. Content spec: A bold, emotionally resonant headline (e.g., \"Capture Life‚Äôs Most Precious Moments with Timeless Photography in Japan\"). A short subheadline (2-3 lines) explaining your unique approach (e.g., \"Our studio specializes in creating natural, heartfelt portraits that tell your family‚Äôs story. Serving individuals and families in [City] with elegance and professionalism.\"). A primary CTA button labeled \"Book Your Session\" linked to a contact form or calendar. A secondary text link below the button for visitors who want to explore more: \"View Our Gallery ‚Üí\". Layout spec: Full-width section with a large, high-resolution background image (slightly darkened overlay for text readability) showcasing one of your best family or portrait shots. Center-align the headline, subheadline, and CTA vertically and horizontally for a balanced, focused look. Ensure the section is responsive, with text and buttons stacking vertically on mobile devices while maintaining ample spacing. Component spec: The CTA button should be large, with rounded corners, filled with a deep red or forest green color, and white text. It should darken slightly when hovered over. The secondary link should be a simple, underlined text in muted gray, placed 10 pixels below the button. Interactions: The headline and CTA button should fade in smoothly as the page loads, with the button having a slight scale-up effect on hover. The background image should remain static but be optimized for fast loading to avoid delays. Assets: Background image: A high-resolution photograph (1920x1080px or larger) featuring a candid, emotionally rich family or individual portrait. Preferred format: JPEG or WebP for optimal quality and load speed. Alt text for the image: \"A heartfelt family portrait session in [City], Japan, capturing timeless moments with professional photography.\" Footer Include a centered logo placeholder at the top of the footer. Add three social media icon placeholders (circular, minimalist style) below the logo, representing platforms where your studio is active. Include a copyright line: \"¬© [Year] [Your Studio Name].

Avoid \"cyberpunk\" clich√©s (no neon green hacker tropes). Think **Apple‚Äôs simplicity meets enterprise trust**. **Color Palette:** **Primary:** Deep navy blue (trust, security) + electric blue accents (innovation). **Secondary:** Soft gray for backgrounds (neutrality) + white text for contrast. **CTA Button:** Bright, **high-contrast orange** (stands out against blue, implies urgency). Darkens slightly on hover. **Typography:** **Headlines:** Bold, **sans-serif** (e.g., a **geometric, slightly condensed** font) for impact.

    "userRequest": "Create a landing page with these sections: Header, Hero, Lead Capture Form, Footer. Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my agency following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, high-contrast layout with a \"revenue growth\" aesthetic‚Äîthink bold typography, directional cues (arrows, lines) guiding the eye toward CTAs, and a subtle gradient overlay on hero images to imply upward momentum. Avoid stock photos of people in offices; instead, use candid screenshots of real landing pages you‚Äôve optimized, with annotations highlighting improvements. Color palette direction: Primary color should be a deep, trust-building blue (associated with professionalism and stability) paired with an energetic secondary accent like coral or emerald green for CTAs. Use a near-black dark gray for body text to ensure readability. Avoid bright, distracting colors that might undermine credibility. Typography direction: Headlines should use a bold, slightly condensed sans-serif to maximize impact in tight spaces (e.g., hero sections). Body copy should be a highly readable, neutral sans-serif with generous line height (1.6x font size). Avoid script or decorative fonts entirely‚Äîthis audience prioritizes clarity over creativity. Spacing and hierarchy: Use a modular 8px grid system for consistent spacing. Hero section should have 120px of whitespace above the headline on desktop (60px on mobile) to create breathing room. Section dividers should use subtle wave or angled shapes (not harsh lines) to guide scrolling. Cards (e.g., case studies) should have 24px internal padding and 16px margins. Buttons and links: Primary CTAs should be pill-shaped with a slight drop shadow to appear clickable. Use a two-tone hover effect (e.g., button darkens 10% while text lightens 10%) for feedback. Secondary links (e.g., \"Read more\") should be underlined but use the same accent color as primary CTAs for consistency. Avoid outline-style buttons‚Äîthey appear less urgent. Micro-interactions and motion: All animations should serve a purpose (e.g., a case study card lifts slightly on hover to invite clicks). Use CSS-driven fades for section transitions as the user scrolls (no jarring slides). The ROI calculator should include a subtle \"ping\" animation when results update to draw attention to the revenue projection. Imagery style: Prioritize authentic, high-resolution screenshots of landing pages you‚Äôve built, cropped to focus on the above-the-fold section. Overlay subtle annotations (e.g., \"Added urgency with a countdown timer ‚Üí 37% lift\") to highlight your expertise. For team photos, use candid shots in a work environment (e.g., pointing at a screen) rather than staged portraits. Avoid generic \"business handshake\" stock images. Header Purpose: Establish credibility and provide instant navigation to key sections. Content spec: Logo placeholder (left-aligned, links to home). Primary navigation menu (center-aligned): Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA button (right-aligned): \"Get Your Free Audit\" (links to lead capture section). Layout spec: Fixed header that shrinks by 20% on scroll to maximize screen real estate. Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu with the CTA button remaining visible. Desktop breakpoint: 1200px max-width; mobile breakpoint: 375px. Component spec: Navigation links should have a 2px underline on hover (animated over 0.2s). CTA button should have a pulse animation (subtle, 2s interval) to draw attention. Interactions: Smooth scroll to section when nav links are clicked. Header background transitions from transparent to solid white on scroll. Hero Purpose: Hook visitors with a revenue-focused headline and capture leads immediately. Content spec: Headline: \"Turn More Visitors Into Paying Customers‚ÄîWithout Guesswork\" (max 60 characters for mobile). Subheadline: \"We‚Äôve increased conversions by up to 300% for businesses like yours. Get a free audit to see how much revenue you‚Äôre leaving on the table.\" Primary CTA button: \"Claim Your Free Audit\" (links to embedded form). Secondary text link: \"See how we do it ‚Üí\" (links to case studies section). Hero image: Split-screen comparison of a generic landing page (left) vs. your optimized version (right), with a red circle annotation highlighting a key improvement (e.g., \"Added trust badges here ‚Üí 22% lift\"). Layout spec: Desktop: 50/50 split (copy left, image right). Mobile: Stacked (copy above image). Min height: 80vh on desktop, 100vh on mobile to ensure full-screen impact. CTA button should be 60px tall with 40px horizontal padding for easy tapping on mobile. Component spec: Embedded lead capture form (3 fields max: name, email, website URL) with a submit button. Floating trust badges below the form (e.g., \"50+ Happy Clients\", \"Avg. 2.3x ROI\"). Interactions: Form fields should have a subtle glow on focus (2px box shadow in brand accent color). Hero image should parallax scroll at 30% speed for depth. Assets: Image: High-resolution PNG of split-screen landing page comparison (1200x800px). Alt text: \"Before and after comparison of a high-converting landing page optimization by [Agency Name].\" Social Proof with Case Studies Purpose: Build trust by showcasing real revenue gains for similar businesses. Content spec: Section headline: \"Proven Results for Businesses Like Yours\" (center-aligned). Three case study cards, each with: Client name and industry (e.g., \"Sarah L. | E-commerce Jewelry Brand\"). Key metric: \"3.1x increase in sales from the same ad spend.\" Before/after screenshot slider (draggable to compare). Quote: \"They identified leaks in our funnel we didn‚Äôt even know existed. Revenue jumped overnight.\" CTA: \"See Full Case Study\" (links to expanded view). Section CTA: \"Ready to see similar results? Book a strategy call.\" Layout spec: Desktop: 3-column grid with equal-height cards. Mobile: Single-column stack. Cards should have a 1px border in light gray with a 10px border radius. Screenshot slider should be 400px wide on desktop (full-width on mobile). Component spec: Interactive before/after slider with a draggable handle (circle with double-arrow icon). Metric highlights should use a bold, larger font size (e.g., 24px) in the accent color. Interactions: Slider handle should snap to 50/50 on load, then be draggable left/right. Cards should lift 5px on hover with a subtle shadow (CSS transform + box-shadow). Assets: Images: High-resolution PNGs of client landing pages (before/after, 800x600px each). Alt text: \"Before and after optimization for [Client Industry] showing a [X]% increase in conversions.\" Interactive ROI Calculator Purpose: Personalize the value proposition by showing visitors their potential revenue gains. Content spec: Headline: \"Calculate Your Untapped Revenue\" (center-aligned). Subheadline: \"Adjust the sliders below to see how much more you could earn with a high-converting landing page.\" Calculator inputs: Monthly visitors (slider: 1K‚Äì100K). Current conversion rate (slider: 0.5%‚Äì10%). Average order value (slider: $20‚Äì$500). Dynamic output: \"With a 2% lift, you‚Äôd earn $X more per month.\" CTA button: \"Get Your Custom Plan\" (links to lead capture form). Disclaimer: \"Results based on average client performance. Actual gains may vary.\" Layout spec: Desktop: Calculator centered in a 600px-wide container. Mobile: Full-width with stacked sliders. Sliders should be 100% width of their container with the current value displayed in a bubble above the thumb. Result output should be in a highlighted box (light gray background) with the dollar amount in 32px bold font. Component spec: Three horizontal sliders with numeric inputs (editable fields) for precision. Real-time calculation updates as sliders move (no \"submit\" button needed). Interactions: Sliders should animate smoothly (0.3s transition) when dragged. Result box should pulse once (1.5s animation) when the calculated value updates. Footer Purpose: Reinforce credibility and provide secondary conversion paths. Content spec: Logo placeholder (center-aligned). Social media icons (placeholder links for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram). Copyright text: \"¬© 2024 [Agency Name]. All rights reserved.\" Repeated navigation links: Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA: \"Not ready to commit? Download our free landing page checklist.\" (links to lead magnet). Layout spec: Desktop: 4-column layout (logo + social, nav links, CTA, copyright). Mobile: Single-column stack. Background color: Dark gray (#121212) with white text for contrast. Component spec: Social icons should be monochrome (white) and increase opacity on hover. CTA link should be underlined with an arrow icon (‚Üí) for emphasis.",

    "userRequest": "Create a landing page with these sections: Header, Hero, Lead Capture Form, Footer. Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my agency following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, high-contrast layout with a \"revenue growth\" aesthetic‚Äîthink bold typography, directional cues (arrows, lines) guiding the eye toward CTAs, and a subtle gradient overlay on hero images to imply upward momentum. Avoid stock photos of people in offices; instead, use candid screenshots of real landing pages you‚Äôve optimized, with annotations highlighting improvements. Color palette direction: Primary color should be a deep, trust-building blue (associated with professionalism and stability) paired with an energetic secondary accent like coral or emerald green for CTAs. Use a near-black dark gray for body text to ensure readability. Avoid bright, distracting colors that might undermine credibility. Typography direction: Headlines should use a bold, slightly condensed sans-serif to maximize impact in tight spaces (e.g., hero sections). Body copy should be a highly readable, neutral sans-serif with generous line height (1.6x font size). Avoid script or decorative fonts entirely‚Äîthis audience prioritizes clarity over creativity. Spacing and hierarchy: Use a modular 8px grid system for consistent spacing. Hero section should have 120px of whitespace above the headline on desktop (60px on mobile) to create breathing room. Section dividers should use subtle wave or angled shapes (not harsh lines) to guide scrolling. Cards (e.g., case studies) should have 24px internal padding and 16px margins. Buttons and links: Primary CTAs should be pill-shaped with a slight drop shadow to appear clickable. Use a two-tone hover effect (e.g., button darkens 10% while text lightens 10%) for feedback. Secondary links (e.g., \"Read more\") should be underlined but use the same accent color as primary CTAs for consistency. Avoid outline-style buttons‚Äîthey appear less urgent. Micro-interactions and motion: All animations should serve a purpose (e.g., a case study card lifts slightly on hover to invite clicks). Use CSS-driven fades for section transitions as the user scrolls (no jarring slides). The ROI calculator should include a subtle \"ping\" animation when results update to draw attention to the revenue projection. Imagery style: Prioritize authentic, high-resolution screenshots of landing pages you‚Äôve built, cropped to focus on the above-the-fold section. Overlay subtle annotations (e.g., \"Added urgency with a countdown timer ‚Üí 37% lift\") to highlight your expertise. For team photos, use candid shots in a work environment (e.g., pointing at a screen) rather than staged portraits. Avoid generic \"business handshake\" stock images. Header Purpose: Establish credibility and provide instant navigation to key sections. Content spec: Logo placeholder (left-aligned, links to home). Primary navigation menu (center-aligned): Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA button (right-aligned): \"Get Your Free Audit\" (links to lead capture section). Layout spec: Fixed header that shrinks by 20% on scroll to maximize screen real estate. Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu with the CTA button remaining visible. Desktop breakpoint: 1200px max-width; mobile breakpoint: 375px. Component spec: Navigation links should have a 2px underline on hover (animated over 0.2s). CTA button should have a pulse animation (subtle, 2s interval) to draw attention. Interactions: Smooth scroll to section when nav links are clicked. Header background transitions from transparent to solid white on scroll. Hero Purpose: Hook visitors with a revenue-focused headline and capture leads immediately. Content spec: Headline: \"Turn More Visitors Into Paying Customers‚ÄîWithout Guesswork\" (max 60 characters for mobile). Subheadline: \"We‚Äôve increased conversions by up to 300% for businesses like yours. Get a free audit to see how much revenue you‚Äôre leaving on the table.\" Primary CTA button: \"Claim Your Free Audit\" (links to embedded form). Secondary text link: \"See how we do it ‚Üí\" (links to case studies section). Hero image: Split-screen comparison of a generic landing page (left) vs. your optimized version (right), with a red circle annotation highlighting a key improvement (e.g., \"Added trust badges here ‚Üí 22% lift\"). Layout spec: Desktop: 50/50 split (copy left, image right). Mobile: Stacked (copy above image). Min height: 80vh on desktop, 100vh on mobile to ensure full-screen impact. CTA button should be 60px tall with 40px horizontal padding for easy tapping on mobile. Component spec: Embedded lead capture form (3 fields max: name, email, website URL) with a submit button. Floating trust badges below the form (e.g., \"50+ Happy Clients\", \"Avg. 2.3x ROI\"). Interactions: Form fields should have a subtle glow on focus (2px box shadow in brand accent color). Hero image should parallax scroll at 30% speed for depth. Assets: Image: High-resolution PNG of split-screen landing page comparison (1200x800px). Alt text: \"Before and after comparison of a high-converting landing page optimization by [Agency Name].\" Social Proof with Case Studies Purpose: Build trust by showcasing real revenue gains for similar businesses. Content spec: Section headline: \"Proven Results for Businesses Like Yours\" (center-aligned). Three case study cards, each with: Client name and industry (e.g., \"Sarah L. | E-commerce Jewelry Brand\"). Key metric: \"3.1x increase in sales from the same ad spend.\" Before/after screenshot slider (draggable to compare). Quote: \"They identified leaks in our funnel we didn‚Äôt even know existed. Revenue jumped overnight.\" CTA: \"See Full Case Study\" (links to expanded view). Section CTA: \"Ready to see similar results? Book a strategy call.\" Layout spec: Desktop: 3-column grid with equal-height cards. Mobile: Single-column stack. Cards should have a 1px border in light gray with a 10px border radius. Screenshot slider should be 400px wide on desktop (full-width on mobile). Component spec: Interactive before/after slider with a draggable handle (circle with double-arrow icon). Metric highlights should use a bold, larger font size (e.g., 24px) in the accent color. Interactions: Slider handle should snap to 50/50 on load, then be draggable left/right. Cards should lift 5px on hover with a subtle shadow (CSS transform + box-shadow). Assets: Images: High-resolution PNGs of client landing pages (before/after, 800x600px each). Alt text: \"Before and after optimization for [Client Industry] showing a [X]% increase in conversions.\" Interactive ROI Calculator Purpose: Personalize the value proposition by showing visitors their potential revenue gains. Content spec: Headline: \"Calculate Your Untapped Revenue\" (center-aligned). Subheadline: \"Adjust the sliders below to see how much more you could earn with a high-converting landing page.\" Calculator inputs: Monthly visitors (slider: 1K‚Äì100K). Current conversion rate (slider: 0.5%‚Äì10%). Average order value (slider: $20‚Äì$500). Dynamic output: \"With a 2% lift, you‚Äôd earn $X more per month.\" CTA button: \"Get Your Custom Plan\" (links to lead capture form). Disclaimer: \"Results based on average client performance. Actual gains may vary.\" Layout spec: Desktop: Calculator centered in a 600px-wide container. Mobile: Full-width with stacked sliders. Sliders should be 100% width of their container with the current value displayed in a bubble above the thumb. Result output should be in a highlighted box (light gray background) with the dollar amount in 32px bold font. Component spec: Three horizontal sliders with numeric inputs (editable fields) for precision. Real-time calculation updates as sliders move (no \"submit\" button needed). Interactions: Sliders should animate smoothly (0.3s transition) when dragged. Result box should pulse once (1.5s animation) when the calculated value updates. Footer Purpose: Reinforce credibility and provide secondary conversion paths. Content spec: Logo placeholder (center-aligned). Social media icons (placeholder links for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram). Copyright text: \"¬© 2024 [Agency Name]. All rights reserved.\" Repeated navigation links: Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA: \"Not ready to commit? Download our free landing page checklist.\" (links to lead magnet). Layout spec: Desktop: 4-column layout (logo + social, nav links, CTA, copyright). Mobile: Single-column stack. Background color: Dark gray (#121212) with white text for contrast. Component spec: Social icons should be monochrome (white) and increase opacity on hover. CTA link should be underlined with an arrow icon (‚Üí) for emphasis.",

    "userRequest": "Create a landing page with these sections: Header, Hero, Lead Capture Form, Footer. Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my agency following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, high-contrast layout with a \"revenue growth\" aesthetic‚Äîthink bold typography, directional cues (arrows, lines) guiding the eye toward CTAs, and a subtle gradient overlay on hero images to imply upward momentum. Avoid stock photos of people in offices; instead, use candid screenshots of real landing pages you‚Äôve optimized, with annotations highlighting improvements. Color palette direction: Primary color should be a deep, trust-building blue (associated with professionalism and stability) paired with an energetic secondary accent like coral or emerald green for CTAs. Use a near-black dark gray for body text to ensure readability. Avoid bright, distracting colors that might undermine credibility. Typography direction: Headlines should use a bold, slightly condensed sans-serif to maximize impact in tight spaces (e.g., hero sections). Body copy should be a highly readable, neutral sans-serif with generous line height (1.6x font size). Avoid script or decorative fonts entirely‚Äîthis audience prioritizes clarity over creativity. Spacing and hierarchy: Use a modular 8px grid system for consistent spacing. Hero section should have 120px of whitespace above the headline on desktop (60px on mobile) to create breathing room. Section dividers should use subtle wave or angled shapes (not harsh lines) to guide scrolling. Cards (e.g., case studies) should have 24px internal padding and 16px margins. Buttons and links: Primary CTAs should be pill-shaped with a slight drop shadow to appear clickable. Use a two-tone hover effect (e.g., button darkens 10% while text lightens 10%) for feedback. Secondary links (e.g., \"Read more\") should be underlined but use the same accent color as primary CTAs for consistency. Avoid outline-style buttons‚Äîthey appear less urgent. Micro-interactions and motion: All animations should serve a purpose (e.g., a case study card lifts slightly on hover to invite clicks). Use CSS-driven fades for section transitions as the user scrolls (no jarring slides). The ROI calculator should include a subtle \"ping\" animation when results update to draw attention to the revenue projection. Imagery style: Prioritize authentic, high-resolution screenshots of landing pages you‚Äôve built, cropped to focus on the above-the-fold section. Overlay subtle annotations (e.g., \"Added urgency with a countdown timer ‚Üí 37% lift\") to highlight your expertise. For team photos, use candid shots in a work environment (e.g., pointing at a screen) rather than staged portraits. Avoid generic \"business handshake\" stock images. Header Purpose: Establish credibility and provide instant navigation to key sections. Content spec: Logo placeholder (left-aligned, links to home). Primary navigation menu (center-aligned): Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA button (right-aligned): \"Get Your Free Audit\" (links to lead capture section). Layout spec: Fixed header that shrinks by 20% on scroll to maximize screen real estate. Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu with the CTA button remaining visible. Desktop breakpoint: 1200px max-width; mobile breakpoint: 375px. Component spec: Navigation links should have a 2px underline on hover (animated over 0.2s). CTA button should have a pulse animation (subtle, 2s interval) to draw attention. Interactions: Smooth scroll to section when nav links are clicked. Header background transitions from transparent to solid white on scroll. Hero Purpose: Hook visitors with a revenue-focused headline and capture leads immediately. Content spec: Headline: \"Turn More Visitors Into Paying Customers‚ÄîWithout Guesswork\" (max 60 characters for mobile). Subheadline: \"We‚Äôve increased conversions by up to 300% for businesses like yours. Get a free audit to see how much revenue you‚Äôre leaving on the table.\" Primary CTA button: \"Claim Your Free Audit\" (links to embedded form). Secondary text link: \"See how we do it ‚Üí\" (links to case studies section). Hero image: Split-screen comparison of a generic landing page (left) vs. your optimized version (right), with a red circle annotation highlighting a key improvement (e.g., \"Added trust badges here ‚Üí 22% lift\"). Layout spec: Desktop: 50/50 split (copy left, image right). Mobile: Stacked (copy above image). Min height: 80vh on desktop, 100vh on mobile to ensure full-screen impact. CTA button should be 60px tall with 40px horizontal padding for easy tapping on mobile. Component spec: Embedded lead capture form (3 fields max: name, email, website URL) with a submit button. Floating trust badges below the form (e.g., \"50+ Happy Clients\", \"Avg. 2.3x ROI\"). Interactions: Form fields should have a subtle glow on focus (2px box shadow in brand accent color). Hero image should parallax scroll at 30% speed for depth. Assets: Image: High-resolution PNG of split-screen landing page comparison (1200x800px). Alt text: \"Before and after comparison of a high-converting landing page optimization by [Agency Name].\" Social Proof with Case Studies Purpose: Build trust by showcasing real revenue gains for similar businesses.

Three case study cards, each with: Client name and industry (e.g., \"Sarah L. | E-commerce Jewelry Brand\"). Key metric: \"3.1x increase in sales from the same ad spend.\" Before/after screenshot slider (draggable to compare). Quote: \"They identified leaks in our funnel we didn‚Äôt even know existed. Revenue jumped overnight.\" CTA: \"See Full Case Study\" (links to expanded view). Section CTA: \"Ready to see similar results? Book a strategy call.\" Layout spec: Desktop: 3-column grid with equal-height cards. Mobile: Single-column stack. Cards should have a 1px border in light gray with a 10px border radius. Screenshot slider should be 400px wide on desktop (full-width on mobile). Component spec: Interactive before/after slider with a draggable handle (circle with double-arrow icon). Metric highlights should use a bold, larger font size (e.g., 24px) in the accent color. Interactions: Slider handle should snap to 50/50 on load, then be draggable left/right. Cards should lift 5px on hover with a subtle shadow (CSS transform + box-shadow). Assets: Images: High-resolution PNGs of client landing pages (before/after, 800x600px each). Alt text: \"Before and after optimization for [Client Industry] showing a [X]% increase in conversions.\" Interactive ROI Calculator Purpose: Personalize the value proposition by showing visitors their potential revenue gains. Content spec: Headline: \"Calculate Your Untapped Revenue\" (center-aligned). Subheadline: \"Adjust the sliders below to see how much more you could earn with a high-converting landing page.\" Calculator inputs: Monthly visitors (slider: 1K‚Äì100K). Current conversion rate (slider: 0.5%‚Äì10%). Average order value (slider: $20‚Äì$500). Dynamic output: \"With a 2% lift, you‚Äôd earn $X more per month.\" CTA button: \"Get Your Custom Plan\" (links to lead capture form). Disclaimer: \"Results based on average client performance. Actual gains may vary.\" Layout spec: Desktop: Calculator centered in a 600px-wide container. Mobile: Full-width with stacked sliders. Sliders should be 100% width of their container with the current value displayed in a bubble above the thumb. Result output should be in a highlighted box (light gray background) with the dollar amount in 32px bold font. Component spec: Three horizontal sliders with numeric inputs (editable fields) for precision. Real-time calculation updates as sliders move (no \"submit\" button needed). Interactions: Sliders should animate smoothly (0.3s transition) when dragged. Result box should pulse once (1.5s animation) when the calculated value updates. Footer Purpose: Reinforce credibility and provide secondary conversion paths. Content spec: Logo placeholder (center-aligned). Social media icons (placeholder links for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram). Copyright text: \"¬© 2024 [Agency Name]. All rights reserved.\" Repeated navigation links: Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA: \"Not ready to commit? Download our free landing page checklist.\" (links to lead magnet). Layout spec: Desktop: 4-column layout (logo + social, nav links, CTA, copyright). Mobile: Single-column stack. Background color: Dark gray (#121212) with white text for contrast. Component spec: Social icons should be monochrome (white) and increase opacity on hover. CTA link should be underlined with an arrow icon (‚Üí) for emphasis.",

Avoid stock photos of people in offices; instead, use candid screenshots of real landing pages you‚Äôve optimized, with annotations highlighting improvements. Color palette direction: Primary color should be a deep, trust-building blue (associated with professionalism and stability) paired with an energetic secondary accent like coral or emerald green for CTAs. Use a near-black dark gray for body text to ensure readability. Avoid bright, distracting colors that might undermine credibility. Typography direction: Headlines should use a bold, slightly condensed sans-serif to maximize impact in tight spaces (e.g., hero sections). Body copy should be a highly readable, neutral sans-serif with generous line height (1.6x font size). Avoid script or decorative fonts entirely‚Äîthis audience prioritizes clarity over creativity. Spacing and hierarchy: Use a modular 8px grid system for consistent spacing. Hero section should have 120px of whitespace above the headline on desktop (60px on mobile) to create breathing room. Section dividers should use subtle wave or angled shapes (not harsh lines) to guide scrolling. Cards (e.g., case studies) should have 24px internal padding and 16px margins. Buttons and links: Primary CTAs should be pill-shaped with a slight drop shadow to appear clickable. Use a two-tone hover effect (e.g., button darkens 10% while text lightens 10%) for feedback. Secondary links (e.g., \"Read more\") should be underlined but use the same accent color as primary CTAs for consistency. Avoid outline-style buttons‚Äîthey appear less urgent. Micro-interactions and motion: All animations should serve a purpose (e.g., a case study card lifts slightly on hover to invite clicks). Use CSS-driven fades for section transitions as the user scrolls (no jarring slides). The ROI calculator should include a subtle \"ping\" animation when results update to draw attention to the revenue projection. Imagery style: Prioritize authentic, high-resolution screenshots of landing pages you‚Äôve built, cropped to focus on the above-the-fold section. Overlay subtle annotations (e.g., \"Added urgency with a countdown timer ‚Üí 37% lift\") to highlight your expertise. For team photos, use candid shots in a work environment (e.g., pointing at a screen) rather than staged portraits. Avoid generic \"business handshake\" stock images. Header Purpose: Establish credibility and provide instant navigation to key sections. Content spec: Logo placeholder (left-aligned, links to home). Primary navigation menu (center-aligned): Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA button (right-aligned): \"Get Your Free Audit\" (links to lead capture section). Layout spec: Fixed header that shrinks by 20% on scroll to maximize screen real estate. Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu with the CTA button remaining visible. Desktop breakpoint: 1200px max-width; mobile breakpoint: 375px. Component spec: Navigation links should have a 2px underline on hover (animated over 0.2s). CTA button should have a pulse animation (subtle, 2s interval) to draw attention. Interactions: Smooth scroll to section when nav links are clicked. Header background transitions from transparent to solid white on scroll. Hero Purpose: Hook visitors with a revenue-focused headline and capture leads immediately. Content spec: Headline: \"Turn More Visitors Into Paying Customers‚ÄîWithout Guesswork\" (max 60 characters for mobile). Subheadline: \"We‚Äôve increased conversions by up to 300% for businesses like yours. Get a free audit to see how much revenue you‚Äôre leaving on the table.\" Primary CTA button: \"Claim Your Free Audit\" (links to embedded form). Secondary text link: \"See how we do it ‚Üí\" (links to case studies section). Hero image: Split-screen comparison of a generic landing page (left) vs. your optimized version (right), with a red circle annotation highlighting a key improvement (e.g., \"Added trust badges here ‚Üí 22% lift\"). Layout spec: Desktop: 50/50 split (copy left, image right). Mobile: Stacked (copy above image). Min height: 80vh on desktop, 100vh on mobile to ensure full-screen impact. CTA button should be 60px tall with 40px horizontal padding for easy tapping on mobile. Component spec: Embedded lead capture form (3 fields max: name, email, website URL) with a submit button. Floating trust badges below the form (e.g., \"50+ Happy Clients\", \"Avg. 2.3x ROI\"). Interactions: Form fields should have a subtle glow on focus (2px box shadow in brand accent color). Hero image should parallax scroll at 30% speed for depth. Assets: Image: High-resolution PNG of split-screen landing page comparison (1200x800px). Alt text: \"Before and after comparison of a high-converting landing page optimization by [Agency Name].\" Social Proof with Case Studies Purpose: Build trust by showcasing real revenue gains for similar businesses. Content spec: Section headline: \"Proven Results for Businesses Like Yours\" (center-aligned). Three case study cards, each with: Client name and industry (e.g., \"Sarah L. | E-commerce Jewelry Brand\"). Key metric: \"3.1x increase in sales from the same ad spend.\" Before/after screenshot slider (draggable to compare). Quote: \"They identified leaks in our funnel we didn‚Äôt even know existed. Revenue jumped overnight.\" CTA: \"See Full Case Study\" (links to expanded view). Section CTA: \"Ready to see similar results? Book a strategy call.\" Layout spec: Desktop: 3-column grid with equal-height cards. Mobile: Single-column stack. Cards should have a 1px border in light gray with a 10px border radius. Screenshot slider should be 400px wide on desktop (full-width on mobile). Component spec: Interactive before/after slider with a draggable handle (circle with double-arrow icon). Metric highlights should use a bold, larger font size (e.g., 24px) in the accent color. Interactions: Slider handle should snap to 50/50 on load, then be draggable left/right. Cards should lift 5px on hover with a subtle shadow (CSS transform + box-shadow). Assets: Images: High-resolution PNGs of client landing pages (before/after, 800x600px each). Alt text: \"Before and after optimization for [Client Industry] showing a [X]% increase in conversions.\" Interactive ROI Calculator Purpose: Personalize the value proposition by showing visitors their potential revenue gains. Content spec: Headline: \"Calculate Your Untapped Revenue\" (center-aligned). Subheadline: \"Adjust the sliders below to see how much more you could earn with a high-converting landing page.\" Calculator inputs: Monthly visitors (slider: 1K‚Äì100K). Current conversion rate (slider: 0.5%‚Äì10%). Average order value (slider: $20‚Äì$500). Dynamic output: \"With a 2% lift, you‚Äôd earn $X more per month.\" CTA button: \"Get Your Custom Plan\" (links to lead capture form). Disclaimer: \"Results based on average client performance. Actual gains may vary.\" Layout spec: Desktop: Calculator centered in a 600px-wide container. Mobile: Full-width with stacked sliders. Sliders should be 100% width of their container with the current value displayed in a bubble above the thumb. Result output should be in a highlighted box (light gray background) with the dollar amount in 32px bold font. Component spec: Three horizontal sliders with numeric inputs (editable fields) for precision. Real-time calculation updates as sliders move (no \"submit\" button needed). Interactions: Sliders should animate smoothly (0.3s transition) when dragged. Result box should pulse once (1.5s animation) when the calculated value updates. Footer Purpose: Reinforce credibility and provide secondary conversion paths. Content spec: Logo placeholder (center-aligned). Social media icons (placeholder links for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram). Copyright text: \"¬© 2024 [Agency Name]. All rights reserved.\" Repeated navigation links: Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA: \"Not ready to commit? Download our free landing page checklist.\" (links to lead magnet). Layout spec: Desktop: 4-column layout (logo + social, nav links, CTA, copyright). Mobile: Single-column stack. Background color: Dark gray (#121212) with white text for contrast. Component spec: Social icons should be monochrome (white) and increase opacity on hover. CTA link should be underlined with an arrow icon (‚Üí) for emphasis.",

Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my agency following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, high-contrast layout with a \"revenue growth\" aesthetic‚Äîthink bold typography, directional cues (arrows, lines) guiding the eye toward CTAs, and a subtle gradient overlay on hero images to imply upward momentum. Avoid stock photos of people in offices; instead, use candid screenshots of real landing pages you‚Äôve optimized, with annotations highlighting improvements. Color palette direction: Primary color should be a deep, trust-building blue (associated with professionalism and stability) paired with an energetic secondary accent like coral or emerald green for CTAs. Use a near-black dark gray for body text to ensure readability. Avoid bright, distracting colors that might undermine credibility. Typography direction: Headlines should use a bold, slightly condensed sans-serif to maximize impact in tight spaces (e.g., hero sections). Body copy should be a highly readable, neutral sans-serif with generous line height (1.6x font size). Avoid script or decorative fonts entirely‚Äîthis audience prioritizes clarity over creativity. Spacing and hierarchy: Use a modular 8px grid system for consistent spacing. Hero section should have 120px of whitespace above the headline on desktop (60px on mobile) to create breathing room. Section dividers should use subtle wave or angled shapes (not harsh lines) to guide scrolling. Cards (e.g., case studies) should have 24px internal padding and 16px margins. Buttons and links: Primary CTAs should be pill-shaped with a slight drop shadow to appear clickable. Use a two-tone hover effect (e.g., button darkens 10% while text lightens 10%) for feedback. Secondary links (e.g., \"Read more\") should be underlined but use the same accent color as primary CTAs for consistency. Avoid outline-style buttons‚Äîthey appear less urgent. Micro-interactions and motion: All animations should serve a purpose (e.g., a case study card lifts slightly on hover to invite clicks). Use CSS-driven fades for section transitions as the user scrolls (no jarring slides). The ROI calculator should include a subtle \"ping\" animation when results update to draw attention to the revenue projection. Imagery style: Prioritize authentic, high-resolution screenshots of landing pages you‚Äôve built, cropped to focus on the above-the-fold section. Overlay subtle annotations (e.g., \"Added urgency with a countdown timer ‚Üí 37% lift\") to highlight your expertise. For team photos, use candid shots in a work environment (e.g., pointing at a screen) rather than staged portraits. Avoid generic \"business handshake\" stock images. Header Purpose: Establish credibility and provide instant navigation to key sections. Content spec: Logo placeholder (left-aligned, links to home). Primary navigation menu (center-aligned): Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA button (right-aligned): \"Get Your Free Audit\" (links to lead capture section). Layout spec: Fixed header that shrinks by 20% on scroll to maximize screen real estate. Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu with the CTA button remaining visible. Desktop breakpoint: 1200px max-width; mobile breakpoint: 375px. Component spec: Navigation links should have a 2px underline on hover (animated over 0.2s). CTA button should have a pulse animation (subtle, 2s interval) to draw attention. Interactions: Smooth scroll to section when nav links are clicked. Header background transitions from transparent to solid white on scroll. Hero Purpose: Hook visitors with a revenue-focused headline and capture leads immediately. Content spec: Headline: \"Turn More Visitors Into Paying Customers‚ÄîWithout Guesswork\" (max 60 characters for mobile).

Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my agency following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, high-contrast layout with a \"revenue growth\" aesthetic‚Äîthink bold typography, directional cues (arrows, lines) guiding the eye toward CTAs, and a subtle gradient overlay on hero images to imply upward momentum. Avoid stock photos of people in offices; instead, use candid screenshots of real landing pages you‚Äôve optimized, with annotations highlighting improvements. Color palette direction: Primary color should be a deep, trust-building blue (associated with professionalism and stability) paired with an energetic secondary accent like coral or emerald green for CTAs. Use a near-black dark gray for body text to ensure readability. Avoid bright, distracting colors that might undermine credibility. Typography direction: Headlines should use a bold, slightly condensed sans-serif to maximize impact in tight spaces (e.g., hero sections). Body copy should be a highly readable, neutral sans-serif with generous line height (1.6x font size). Avoid script or decorative fonts entirely‚Äîthis audience prioritizes clarity over creativity. Spacing and hierarchy: Use a modular 8px grid system for consistent spacing. Hero section should have 120px of whitespace above the headline on desktop (60px on mobile) to create breathing room. Section dividers should use subtle wave or angled shapes (not harsh lines) to guide scrolling. Cards (e.g., case studies) should have 24px internal padding and 16px margins. Buttons and links: Primary CTAs should be pill-shaped with a slight drop shadow to appear clickable. Use a two-tone hover effect (e.g., button darkens 10% while text lightens 10%) for feedback. Secondary links (e.g., \"Read more\") should be underlined but use the same accent color as primary CTAs for consistency. Avoid outline-style buttons‚Äîthey appear less urgent. Micro-interactions and motion: All animations should serve a purpose (e.g., a case study card lifts slightly on hover to invite clicks). Use CSS-driven fades for section transitions as the user scrolls (no jarring slides). The ROI calculator should include a subtle \"ping\" animation when results update to draw attention to the revenue projection. Imagery style: Prioritize authentic, high-resolution screenshots of landing pages you‚Äôve built, cropped to focus on the above-the-fold section. Overlay subtle annotations (e.g., \"Added urgency with a countdown timer ‚Üí 37% lift\") to highlight your expertise. For team photos, use candid shots in a work environment (e.g., pointing at a screen) rather than staged portraits. Avoid generic \"business handshake\" stock images.

Primary navigation menu (center-aligned): Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA button (right-aligned): \"Get Your Free Audit\" (links to lead capture section). Layout spec: Fixed header that shrinks by 20% on scroll to maximize screen real estate. Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu with the CTA button remaining visible. Desktop breakpoint: 1200px max-width; mobile breakpoint: 375px. Component spec: Navigation links should have a 2px underline on hover (animated over 0.2s). CTA button should have a pulse animation (subtle, 2s interval) to draw attention. Interactions: Smooth scroll to section when nav links are clicked. Header background transitions from transparent to solid white on scroll. Hero Purpose: Hook visitors with a revenue-focused headline and capture leads immediately. Content spec: Headline: \"Turn More Visitors Into Paying Customers‚ÄîWithout Guesswork\" (max 60 characters for mobile). Subheadline: \"We‚Äôve increased conversions by up to 300% for businesses like yours.

    "userRequest": "Create a landing page with these sections: Header, Hero, Lead Capture Form, Footer. Use this detailed specification: Create a landing page for my agency following:\n\nDesign & User Experience Visual direction: Clean, high-contrast layout with a \"revenue growth\" aesthetic‚Äîthink bold typography, directional cues (arrows, lines) guiding the eye toward CTAs, and a subtle gradient overlay on hero images to imply upward momentum. Avoid stock photos of people in offices; instead, use candid screenshots of real landing pages you‚Äôve optimized, with annotations highlighting improvements. Color palette direction: Primary color should be a deep, trust-building blue (associated with professionalism and stability) paired with an energetic secondary accent like coral or emerald green for CTAs. Use a near-black dark gray for body text to ensure readability. Avoid bright, distracting colors that might undermine credibility. Typography direction: Headlines should use a bold, slightly condensed sans-serif to maximize impact in tight spaces (e.g., hero sections). Body copy should be a highly readable, neutral sans-serif with generous line height (1.6x font size). Avoid script or decorative fonts entirely‚Äîthis audience prioritizes clarity over creativity. Spacing and hierarchy: Use a modular 8px grid system for consistent spacing. Hero section should have 120px of whitespace above the headline on desktop (60px on mobile) to create breathing room. Section dividers should use subtle wave or angled shapes (not harsh lines) to guide scrolling. Cards (e.g., case studies) should have 24px internal padding and 16px margins. Buttons and links: Primary CTAs should be pill-shaped with a slight drop shadow to appear clickable. Use a two-tone hover effect (e.g., button darkens 10% while text lightens 10%) for feedback. Secondary links (e.g., \"Read more\") should be underlined but use the same accent color as primary CTAs for consistency. Avoid outline-style buttons‚Äîthey appear less urgent. Micro-interactions and motion: All animations should serve a purpose (e.g., a case study card lifts slightly on hover to invite clicks). Use CSS-driven fades for section transitions as the user scrolls (no jarring slides). The ROI calculator should include a subtle \"ping\" animation when results update to draw attention to the revenue projection. Imagery style: Prioritize authentic, high-resolution screenshots of landing pages you‚Äôve built, cropped to focus on the above-the-fold section. Overlay subtle annotations (e.g., \"Added urgency with a countdown timer ‚Üí 37% lift\") to highlight your expertise. For team photos, use candid shots in a work environment (e.g., pointing at a screen) rather than staged portraits. Avoid generic \"business handshake\" stock images. Header Purpose: Establish credibility and provide instant navigation to key sections. Content spec: Logo placeholder (left-aligned, links to home). Primary navigation menu (center-aligned): Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA button (right-aligned): \"Get Your Free Audit\" (links to lead capture section). Layout spec: Fixed header that shrinks by 20% on scroll to maximize screen real estate. Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu with the CTA button remaining visible. Desktop breakpoint: 1200px max-width; mobile breakpoint: 375px. Component spec: Navigation links should have a 2px underline on hover (animated over 0.2s). CTA button should have a pulse animation (subtle, 2s interval) to draw attention. Interactions: Smooth scroll to section when nav links are clicked. Header background transitions from transparent to solid white on scroll. Hero Purpose: Hook visitors with a revenue-focused headline and capture leads immediately. Content spec: Headline: \"Turn More Visitors Into Paying Customers‚ÄîWithout Guesswork\" (max 60 characters for mobile). Subheadline: \"We‚Äôve increased conversions by up to 300% for businesses like yours. Get a free audit to see how much revenue you‚Äôre leaving on the table.\" Primary CTA button: \"Claim Your Free Audit\" (links to embedded form). Secondary text link: \"See how we do it ‚Üí\" (links to case studies section). Hero image: Split-screen comparison of a generic landing page (left) vs. your optimized version (right), with a red circle annotation highlighting a key improvement (e.g., \"Added trust badges here ‚Üí 22% lift\"). Layout spec: Desktop: 50/50 split (copy left, image right). Mobile: Stacked (copy above image). Min height: 80vh on desktop, 100vh on mobile to ensure full-screen impact. CTA button should be 60px tall with 40px horizontal padding for easy tapping on mobile. Component spec: Embedded lead capture form (3 fields max: name, email, website URL) with a submit button. Floating trust badges below the form (e.g., \"50+ Happy Clients\", \"Avg. 2.3x ROI\"). Interactions: Form fields should have a subtle glow on focus (2px box shadow in brand accent color). Hero image should parallax scroll at 30% speed for depth. Assets: Image: High-resolution PNG of split-screen landing page comparison (1200x800px). Alt text: \"Before and after comparison of a high-converting landing page optimization by [Agency Name].\" Social Proof with Case Studies Purpose: Build trust by showcasing real revenue gains for similar businesses. Content spec: Section headline: \"Proven Results for Businesses Like Yours\" (center-aligned). Three case study cards, each with: Client name and industry (e.g., \"Sarah L. | E-commerce Jewelry Brand\"). Key metric: \"3.1x increase in sales from the same ad spend.\" Before/after screenshot slider (draggable to compare). Quote: \"They identified leaks in our funnel we didn‚Äôt even know existed. Revenue jumped overnight.\" CTA: \"See Full Case Study\" (links to expanded view). Section CTA: \"Ready to see similar results? Book a strategy call.\" Layout spec: Desktop: 3-column grid with equal-height cards. Mobile: Single-column stack. Cards should have a 1px border in light gray with a 10px border radius. Screenshot slider should be 400px wide on desktop (full-width on mobile). Component spec: Interactive before/after slider with a draggable handle (circle with double-arrow icon). Metric highlights should use a bold, larger font size (e.g., 24px) in the accent color. Interactions: Slider handle should snap to 50/50 on load, then be draggable left/right. Cards should lift 5px on hover with a subtle shadow (CSS transform + box-shadow). Assets: Images: High-resolution PNGs of client landing pages (before/after, 800x600px each). Alt text: \"Before and after optimization for [Client Industry] showing a [X]% increase in conversions.\" Interactive ROI Calculator Purpose: Personalize the value proposition by showing visitors their potential revenue gains. Content spec: Headline: \"Calculate Your Untapped Revenue\" (center-aligned). Subheadline: \"Adjust the sliders below to see how much more you could earn with a high-converting landing page.\" Calculator inputs: Monthly visitors (slider: 1K‚Äì100K). Current conversion rate (slider: 0.5%‚Äì10%). Average order value (slider: $20‚Äì$500). Dynamic output: \"With a 2% lift, you‚Äôd earn $X more per month.\" CTA button: \"Get Your Custom Plan\" (links to lead capture form). Disclaimer: \"Results based on average client performance. Actual gains may vary.\" Layout spec: Desktop: Calculator centered in a 600px-wide container. Mobile: Full-width with stacked sliders. Sliders should be 100% width of their container with the current value displayed in a bubble above the thumb. Result output should be in a highlighted box (light gray background) with the dollar amount in 32px bold font. Component spec: Three horizontal sliders with numeric inputs (editable fields) for precision. Real-time calculation updates as sliders move (no \"submit\" button needed). Interactions: Sliders should animate smoothly (0.3s transition) when dragged. Result box should pulse once (1.5s animation) when the calculated value updates. Footer Purpose: Reinforce credibility and provide secondary conversion paths. Content spec: Logo placeholder (center-aligned). Social media icons (placeholder links for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram). Copyright text: \"¬© 2024 [Agency Name]. All rights reserved.\" Repeated navigation links: Home, How It Works, Case Studies, Pricing, About, Contact. Secondary CTA: \"Not ready to commit? Download our free landing page checklist.\" (links to lead magnet). Layout spec: Desktop: 4-column layout (logo + social, nav links, CTA, copyright). Mobile: Single-column stack. Background color: Dark gray (#121212) with white text for contrast. Component spec: Social icons should be monochrome (white) and increase opacity on hover. CTA link should be underlined with an arrow icon (‚Üí) for emphasis.",
