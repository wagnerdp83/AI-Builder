The user wants a top-tier online fashion boutique website.
This website should have:
- Animated product sliders
- Quick view popups
- Responsive lookbook pages
- Top 0.01% UI (Awwwards level)
- Feature-rich, robust, production-ready
- Dynamic visual effects
- Mobile responsive
- Layered design and depth
- Strong typographic hierarchy
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome Icons
- Example Images from picsum.photos
- No comments in code
- No full SVG, but can use inline SVG
- No SHA for library imports

Color Palette Thinking:
Fashion boutique, so needs to be stylish, modern, and sophisticated.
- Consider a minimalist approach with a neutral base (whites, creams, light greys) to highlight the clothing.
- Accent colors could be used for interaction elements and branding.
- Maybe a pastel or muted color palette to keep it elegant and not too loud.
- Let's choose a soft, desaturated color palette with a focus on visual hierarchy and product presentation.

Typography:
- Strong typographic hierarchy is requested.
- Need to select a good Google Font pairing.
- Headings should be prominent and stylish.
- Body text should be readable and elegant.
- Consider a serif font for headings for a classic fashion feel and a sans-serif for body for readability.

UX Focus (from instructions):
1. **Intuitive Navigation:**
- Clear categories, maybe dropdowns or mega menus for categories.
- Prominent search bar.
- Breadcrumbs for navigation within categories and lookbooks.
- Mobile-first navigation (tab bar or well-designed hamburger menu).
2. **Visual Hierarchy & Layout:**
- High-quality product images are key.
- Clean and spacious layout.
- Use cards for product listings and lookbook items.
- Clear CTAs (Add to cart, Quick View, Shop Now).
3. **Performance Optimization:**
- Lazy loading for images is crucial.
- Optimize CSS and JS.
- Consider image optimization for web.
4. **Accessibility Compliance:**
- Ensure keyboard navigation.
- Alt text for images.
- Color contrast for text and backgrounds.
- Focus states for interactive elements.
5. **Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach.
- Grid layout for product listings and lookbooks.
- Fluid typography and adaptable components.
6. **Component Technical Execution:**
- Product sliders/carousels (JS needed).
- Quick view popups (modals, JS needed).
- Lookbook pages (grid/layout, potentially sliders).
- Forms for newsletter signup, etc.
7. **Interaction Feedback Logic:**
- Animations for hover, click, transitions.
- Smooth scrolling.
- Feedback for actions (e.g., "Added to cart" animation).
8. **Conversion Friction Audit:**
- Streamlined checkout process (though checkout isn't explicitly requested, it's implied for a boutique).
- Clear pricing and product information.
- Trust elements (if applicable, though not strictly requested here).
9. **Future-Proofing Measures:**
- Keep code modular and maintainable.
- Use Tailwind effectively for flexibility.
10. **Edge Case Handling:**
- Empty states (e.g., no search results, empty cart).
- Error handling (though not explicitly requested for this UI design).

Animations and Visual Effects:
- Subtle animations for product sliders, hover states, popups.
- Consider parallax scrolling for lookbook pages for depth.
- Smooth transitions for page navigation.
- Dynamic visual effects - maybe subtle background animations or gradient shifts.

Structure:
- Header (Logo, Navigation, Search, Cart)
- Homepage (Hero Slider, Featured Products, Category Previews, Lookbook Teaser, Newsletter Signup)
- Product Listing Page (Filters, Product Grid, Pagination)
- Product Detail Page (Product Images, Description, Size/Color Options, Add to Cart, Product Slider)
- Lookbook Page (Responsive Grid Layout, Image Sliders)
- Quick View Popup (Product Details, Add to Cart)
- Footer (About Us, Contact, Social Links, Copyright)

Tools and Libraries:
- Tailwind CSS v4 (latest from unpkg)
- Google Fonts (Poppins, Playfair Display - example, can refine)
- Font Awesome (icons)
- Vanilla JS for interactivity (sliders, popups, animations)

Let's start by setting up the basic HTML structure with Tailwind and then build components step by step.
